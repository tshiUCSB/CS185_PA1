					This is not your normal minesweeper game that we all know and love! There are two players: a VR player who is blind to the actual minesweeper maze and non VR device player who can see parts of the minesweeper field as the VR player walks around. Both players must communicate to make sure the VR player doesn't step on any bombs. There is also an added challenge for the VR player to dodge obstacles that come to them during the game. The player can also destroy these objects by 'yeeting' the floor blocks at the flying objects. :)
